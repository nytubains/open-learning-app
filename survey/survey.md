# Survey Framework
These are some survey guidelines for UX research project.

## Pillar 1

**Pre exploration and post exploration questionnaire? Or both?**

1.  We have **pre questionnaire** which includes set of core questions focussing on the user and their expectations about the open learning platform, which also includes userâ€™s demographics.
2.  Then we have **post questionnaire** that happens after the user has explored the website. These questions focus on the experience of the user with Open learning platform interface.

## Pillar 2

**Delivery method for** **pre and post questionnaire**

1.  Recruit the participants and send them the link for a survey and open learning platform
-   Are we doing a pop-up survey on Moodle?
-   Are we sending the separate link to the user for survey?

## Pillar 3

**Time for the user to complete the questionnaire?**

1.  Number and types of questions
-   It will also affect the Quality of response.
-   Yes/No questions and comment questions
2.  Duration
3.  Quality of response

## Pillar 4

**Simplicity**

1.  Make the entire process simpler for the user by trying to reach the objective with easy and less number of questions.
-   Vocabulary used
-   Length of questions
-   Type of questions

**Concerns**

1. Users may not like to fill two separate questionnaire. How can we enhance simplicity for the user?
2. As all the ideas are good, we need to make sure that we are not adding more to the work of the developer. e.g. adding a pop-up survey, adding tracking capabilities.
